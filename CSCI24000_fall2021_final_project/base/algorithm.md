Goal-The goal of main.cpp will be to display the CEO menu and the accompanying functions to
accomplish the options listed in that menu. college.cpp and college.h will deal with the college
information associated with an employee. dates.cpp and dates.h will deal with the dates
associated with an employee. employee.cpp and employee.h will combine the data from college
and dates with the rest of the data left.

Input- main.cpp will take input from the console for the CEO menu, as well as the gathered data
from employee. college.cpp will use the .h file as input, and both will use the original .txt file as
input. dates.cpp will use the .h file as input, and both will use the the original .txt file as input.
employee.h will use college.h and dates.h as input, employee.cpp will use employee, college, and
dates.h as input, and both will use the original .txt file as input.

Output- All of the .cpp and .h files will work towards outputting the required data requested in
the CEO menu in main.cpp. main.cpp will output the CEO menu mentioned earlier as well as the results 
from that menu.

Steps- As mentioned in the previous two sections, the .cpp and .h files will take the original .txt
file as input, and output the whatever is requested from the CEO menu after they are ran.
