Goal- The goal of this program is to properly create a bubble sort algorithm in C, while using pointers.
The goal of function printValues is to display the current values in the array when called. The goal of
function sort is to sort the array in ascending order. The goal of swap is to swap the old array values
with the new array values, making it so the function sort actually sorts the array. 

Input- This program is using the following set of values: 7, 3, 9, 4, 6, 1, 2, 8, 5. These values were
provided to us and are static. The function printValues will use the defined value of MAX (being 9) and the
current values in the array as inputs. The fuction sort should take the same inputs as the function printValues,
as well as the new array values outputted by the fucntion swap. The function swap will use the old array values as 
an input.


Output- When the program this program runs it ouputs the input values specified earlier sorted from lowest 
to highest. The function printValues will ouput the current values in the array when called. The function sort 
will output the new sorted array. The function swap will output the new array values.

Steps- In order to accomplish all of this the program must call on the functions printValues, sort, and
swap. By using a for loop and printf the function printValues will print out the current values in the array.
The function sort will use nested for loops to set up the values to be swapped and later output the new values.   
The funciton swap, will first set a temporary int equal to a pointer that represents the old values,
then it sets the old pointer equal to a pointer that represents the new values, and finally sets
the new pointer equal to temp.
