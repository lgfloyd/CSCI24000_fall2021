Goal- The goal of this program is to use getline and stringstream together in order to manipulate

data coming from an external input.txt file and output the manipulatted data into a output.txt file.

Input- The primary input for the entire program (as I do not plan on using functions and only plan

on having int main()) is the data from the input.txt file mentioned in my goal section.

Output- The primary output for the entire program will be the data going to the output.txt file

mentioned earlier.

Steps- I plan on only having an int main() with one while loop that will continue to loop as long

as the input file has not ended (I will do this using getline). Within the while loop I will place

the incoming ints from input.txt into an array that I can call on later for summing those ints together

in order to output the correct amount of strings in output.txt. Each of these things (the ints array,

the summing of those ints, and the output of the correct amount of strings in output.txt) will all

be handeled by for loops.

Sorry if this algorithm was too short or not detailed enough, my original algorithm didnt save so I had

to rewrite this really quickly too meet the submission deadline.
