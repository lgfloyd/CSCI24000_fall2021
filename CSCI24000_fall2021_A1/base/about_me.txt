Hello, my name is Logan Floyd and I am a sophomore at IUPUI that is majoring in Computer Engineering.
Besides the classes I took in my first year of College, in High School I took multiple Engineering and 
Computer Science classes. As a result, I have a fair amount of background knowledge and experience when 
it comes to the types of classes I will be taking for my major. I am in this class as I need to take it 
in order to get my degree and I have a feeling I will learn a lot of vital information while I am in this
class. During my free time I like to play video games on my own custom built gaming PC (running
Windows 10) that I built last summer. During College I hope to find a good internship that can lead to me 
finding a good job after College, though I really do not know where I would like to work yet. Earlier I mentioned
I built my own gaming PC, I actually started building PCs in 2015 and have built around four different computers
for myself over the years and three for friends who I then sold them to.
